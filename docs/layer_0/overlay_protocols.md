## Overview

Peer-to-peer Internet overlay protocols are a Layer 0 component.

Examples are:
* Devp2p
* Libp2p

## Devp2p 
### Overview
devp2p is the secure networking suite that powers Ethereum, Whisper, and Swarm. It defines a set of networking and peer-to-peer protocols including [RLPx](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/rlpx.md), which it uses for authentication, stream multiplexing, network forming, and protocol multiplexing.

## Libp2p
### Overview
libp2p is the modular secure networking suite that powers IPFS and Polkadot. It defines a set of interfaces for common networking and peer-to-peer protocols. libp2p is fast, robust, and powerful. It uses multiformats for self-description, avoiding algorithm lock-in, and cryptographic agility. libp2p handles Authentication, Transports, Stream Multiplexing, Peer Discovery, Peer Routing, Content Routing, NAT Traversal, and Relay. The coolest thing? It also runs entirely on the browser!
