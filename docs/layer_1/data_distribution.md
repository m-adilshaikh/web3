## Overview
Data distribution protocols is a Layer 1 component.

Examples:
* IPFS
* BigchainDB
* Bluzelle
* Fluence
* Swarm

## IPFS
### Overview
A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open. IPFS is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem. It combines good ideas from Git, BitTorrent, Kademlia, SFS, and the Web. It is like a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging git objects. IPFS provides an interface as simple as the HTTP web, but with permanence built in.

## Fluence
### Overview
Fluence is a network of independent nodes that provide a decentralized, end-to-end encrypted database service. Scalable, reliable and secured by blockchain.

## Swarm
### Overview
Swarm is a distributed storage platform and content distribution service, a native base layer service of the Ethereum web3 stack. The primary objective of Swarm is to provide a sufficiently decentralised and redundant store of Ethereumâ€™s public record, and in particular, to store and distribute DApp code and data as well as blockchain data.
