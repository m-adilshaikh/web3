Low trust interaction platforms are a Layer 1 component.

Example:
* Polkadot

## Polkadot
[[Polkadot|Polkadot]] is a heterogeneous multiâ€‘chain technology. It consists of many parachains with potentially differing characteristics which can make it easier to achieve anonymity or formal verification. Transactions can be spread out across the chains, allowing many more to be processed in the same period of time. Polkadot ensures that each of these blockchains remains secure and that any dealings between them are faithfully executed. Specialised parachains called bridges can be created to link independent chains.
