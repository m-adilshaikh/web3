## Overview
Low trust interaction protocols are a Layer 1 component.

Examples:
* Ethereum
* Bitcoin
* Zcash
* [[Polkadot|Polkadot]] parachains
* [[Substrate|Substrate]] blockchains


## Ethereum
### Overview
Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.

These apps run on a custom built blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property.

## Bitcoin
### Overview
Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Core is the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.

## Zcash
### Overview
Zcash is the first open, permissionless cryptocurrency that can fully protect the privacy of transactions using zero-knowledge cryptography.

## Polkadot parachains
### Overview
A parachain (parallelizable chain) is a simpler form of blockchain, which attaches to the security provided by the [[Polkadot|Polkadot]] Relay Chain rather than providing its own. The Relay Chain is called that because it not only lends security to attached parachains, but also provides a guarantee of secure message-passing between them.

## Substrate blockchains
### Overview
Substrate is a product created by Parity Technologies and is Parity's implementation of a [[Polkadot Runtime Environment|Polkadot Runtime Environment]]. Substrate is a software development framework to build blockchain technologies. Substrate can be used to create standalone blockchains or to build (native) [[parachains|Parachains]].

For more information, see the dedicated [[Substrate|Substrate]] page on this wiki.
