An oracle, in the context of blockchains and smart contracts, is an agent that finds and verifies real-world occurrences and submits this information to a blockchain to be used by smart contracts.

Examples are:
- Oraclize.it
- ChainLink

## Oraclize.it
### Overview
Smart contracts live like in a walled garden, they cannot fetch external data on their own. Oraclize helps by acting as a data carrier, a reliable connection between Web APIs and your Dapp.
