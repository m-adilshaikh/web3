## Overview
State channels are a technique for performing transactions and other state transitions in a second layer built on top of a blockchain. State channels make blockchains more efficient by moving many processes off-chain, while still retaining a blockchain’s characteristic trustworthiness. Payment channels are a type of state channel that allows users to make "off-chain payments" to each other. The term "state channels" generalizes this approach beyond payments.

## Raiden Network
### Overview
The Raiden Network is an off-chain scaling solution, enabling near-instant, low-fee and scalable payments. It’s complementary to the Ethereum blockchain and works with any ERC20 compatible token. It is Ethereum’s version of Bitcoin’s Lightning Network.

## FunFair's Fate Channels
### Overview
A Fate Channel is a State Channel opened for the duration of a gaming session, supporting custom
gaming messages between the FunFair client and server. The only transactions on the blockchain occur
at the beginning and end of the gaming session.
