## Overview
Protocol extensible developer APIs and languages is a Layer 3 component.

Examples are:
* web3.js
* ether.js
* oo7.js
* Solidity
* Rust


## web3.js
### Overview
This is the Ethereum compatible JavaScript API which implements the Generic JSON RPC spec. It's available on npm as a node module, for bower and component as an embeddable js and as a meteor.js package.

## oo7.js
### Overview

## Solidity
### Overview
Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. It was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.
